# BattTimeWidget
This little piece of code lets you have a widget in BitBar that grabs information about your battery &amp; charging status on your Mac computer. 

This widget has been created using imwally's excellent work (you can find it [here](https://github.com/imwally/battstat)). It is just a wrapper to use in bitbar. It gives information about the time left until full charge of the laptop, or the time left until the full discharge of the laptop.

It has not been tested on a desktop computer, as I have not access to one right now.

It is proven to work on macOS 10.12.3 on a Macbook Pro Unibody, but I cannot test it on any other OSes & machines. If you can test it, send me your OS/machine through a message on GitHub or on my personnal [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tdv_fr) and I will add it to the list of working configs.

You are free to use this software however you want as long as you credit to this repo as well as [imwally's repo](https://www.github.com/imwally/battstat).
